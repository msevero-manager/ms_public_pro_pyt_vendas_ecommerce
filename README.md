# 🧾 Python Project — Commercial Analysis (Sales, Items, Coverage & Revenue)

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was developed in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebook** to analyze commercial performance over time, identify best-selling products, evaluate revenue evolution, and compare results by state and category.

The goal is to provide actionable insights for sales and management teams — identifying trends, regional strengths, and product performance — to support data-driven decision-making.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** — data analysis and visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** — exploration and documentation
* **CSV Dataset** — sales data with information about products, categories, revenue, and states
* **Custom Functions** — for dynamic chart creation and number formatting

---

## 🧱 Data Structure

The dataset includes transactional information grouped by **product**, **category**, **state**, and **month**.
Main fields used:

* `Product_Name` — product description
* `Category` — product category (Electronics, Hardware, etc.)
* `State` — sales region
* `Quantity` — number of units sold
* `Revenue` — total sales amount
* `Date` — month of sale
